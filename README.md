xs2413, jed2205, mwc2147

## Milestones
Initial milestones, will be changed as we understand our project and project scope more.

- [X] [Write proposal](proposal.md)
- [X] [Read existing literature](literature-review.md)
- [ ] Process dataset
- [ ] Run 2 models (MODIT, CodeT5)  
    - https://github.com/modit-team/MODIT
    - https://github.com/salesforce/CodeT5 
- [ ] Run on Naive Example (AST with minimal edges)
- [ ] Design Augmented Program Graph (AST w edges)
- [ ] Experiment on best representations, and other hyperparameters to finetune a model.

## Ideas
Run AST augmented with additional edges, on GGNN and GREAT.
