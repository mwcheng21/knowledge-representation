xs2413, jed2205, mwc2147

## Goals by week
(Listed date is Monday)  
- [X] 2/21: write proposal  
- [ ] 2/28: read papers (see github)  
- [ ] 3/7: look at codet5 and modit githubs, try to run  
- [ ] 3/14: spring break  
- [ ] 3/21: Run on naive AST with guidance and context  
- [ ] 3/28: Buffer for naive AST and Modit/CodeT5 running  
- [ ] 4/4: Run on AST with additional edges/new representation  
- [ ] 4/11: Other experimentation  
- [ ] 4/18: Start writing paper  
- [ ] 4/25: Paper, cont  


## Milestones
Initial milestones, will be changed as we understand our project and project scope more.

- [X] [Write proposal](proposal.md)
- [ ] [Read existing literature](literature-review.md)
- [ ] Process dataset
- [ ] Run 2 models (MODIT, CodeT5)  
    - https://github.com/modit-team/MODIT
    - https://github.com/salesforce/CodeT5 
- [ ] Run on Naive Example (AST with minimal edges)
- [ ] Design Augmented Program Graph (AST w edges)
- [ ] Experiment on best representations, and other hyperparameters to finetune a model.

## Ideas
Run AST augmented with additional edges, on GGNN and GREAT.
